# How this works

From a high level this program does the following:

1. Loads a .ply file containing Gaussian Splats
2. Renders the Splats in both 2D and in 3D as a Quilt
3. Displays the quilt in the Looking Glass Display using Bridge InProc

# Loading a .ply file:
1. [What is a Gaussian Splat?](1_Loading/GaussianSplat.md)
2. [What is a .ply file?](1_Loading/PlyLoading.md)

# Rendering
1. [Rendering Particles. Really Fast.](2_Rendering/2DRendering.md)
